# Rapid-Embedded-Education-Kit

Welcome!!!

Teach your students a faster and easier way to design and implement embedded systems using the Arm Mbed API and tools. This course covers the fundamental principles of how to accelerate the development of embedded systems and rapidly prototype various embedded applications.

The teaching materials have been updated to include coverage of Mbed Studio and Mbed CLI.

 

Kit specification:

A full set of lecture slides, ready for use in a typical 10-12-week undergraduate course (full syllabus below)
Lab manual with code solutions for faculty. Labs are based on low-cost but powerful Arm-based hardware platforms.
Prerequisites: Basics of programming in C / C++
Course Aim
To produce students who can design and program Arm-based embedded systems and implement them using commercial API.

 

Learning Outcomes
Knowledge and understanding of
Arm processor architectures
Arm-based microcontrollers as modern embedded computing platforms
High-level programming API as a prototype tool for rapid development of embedded applications
Fundamentals of programming peripherals on microcontrollers
Intellectual
Explain the characteristics of an embedded system and evaluate its benefits and challenges
Identify and explain key features of Arm architectures and processors
Describe the flow of programming an Arm processor
Outline the different components of the Mbed platform, how they relate to programming microcontrollers, and the benefits of a high-level API
Explain how microcontroller peripherals can be controlled through the Mbed API, using digital and analog I/O, interrupts, pulse-width modulation, and timers
Explain key serial communication technologies and how the Mbed API supports them
Explain the features of a Real-time Operating System (RTOS) and how Mbed supports them
Practical
Use the Mbed Command-line Interface (CLI) to import, compile and run projects
Utilize Mbed API functions for digital and analog I/O, interrupts, and pulse-width modulation to control peripherals on a microcontroller
Implement different serial communication protocols, such as UART, SPI, and I2C using Mbed Studio
